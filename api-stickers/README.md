## About 
In this immersion in Java by Alura
I'm going to be learning a little bit of Java, this is my first contact with this language and I'm liking the idea of ​​getting to know Java more thoroughly.

In the first class I learned how to extract data in the form of a list from an API, we used the IMDB API, creating a list of the Top 250 movies.

In the second class we will be creating stickers for Whatsapp from the IMDB API images. 

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
